      <p>We’ve recorded your application details for <strong>{{ applicant_name }}</strong> at <strong>{{ jurisdiction }}</strong> ({{ address }}).</p>
      <p>In a full deployment, we would open the portal, log in, and fill each step—asking you to approve each step before submitting. You can run bulk applications the same way: we’d repeat this flow for each application with your approval at each step.</p>
      <p class="next-steps">For now, use the portal manually with the information above, or try “Fill out an application” to extract and reuse data from a PDF or Word form.</p>
